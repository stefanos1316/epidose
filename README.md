# Epidose: A privacy-preserving epidemic dosimeter based on contact tracing

This repository provides an open source software
reference implementation for an _epidemic dosimeter_.
Just as a [radiation dosimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimeter)
measures dose uptake of external ionizing
radiation, the epidemic dosimeter tracks potential exposure to viruses
or bacteria associated with an epidemic.
The dosimeter measures a person's exposure to an epidemic, such as COVID-19,
based on exposure to contacts that have been tested positive.
The epidemic dosimeter is designed to be widely accessible
and to safeguard privacy.
Specifically, it is designed to run on the $10 open-hardware
[Raspberry Pi Zero-W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)
computer, with a minimal user interface, comprising LED indicators
regarding operation and exposure risk
and a physical interlock switch to allow the release of contact data.
The software is based on the [DP3T](https://github.com/DP-3T/documents)
contact tracing "unlinkable" design and corresponding reference implementation
code, gratefully acknowledging the team's amazing work.

## Rationale
Contact tracing via smartphone apps has been widely touted as an important
way to control and limit the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.
However, basing contact-tracing on phone apps has several limitations.
[According to market reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_smartphone_penetration),
while in higher income countries smartphone penetration is over 60%, in
lower income ones it drops significantly, even to less than 20%.
Even in higher income countries, smartphone penetration declines significantly
with [increased age](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCE.2016.2614524)
and reduced income.
Also, Bluetooth-based contact tracing apps may not be able to run on
older smartphone models, and many fear compromised privacy when running
such an app on their phone.
Contact tracing app solutions benefit only those using them by flagging
at an early stage one at risk.
Therefore, older people who are usually less accustomed to technology
(and also run greater risks) and less privileged society members are
at a disadvantage.

Exposure tracking solutions can only be successful if adopted by a
significant percentage of the population.
In lower income regions and countries
(which could be
[devastated by COVID-19](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/03/26/the-coronavirus-could-devastate-poor-countries)),
smartphone-based solutions are unlikely to be effective due to a lack
of critical mass.
The proposed epidemic dosimeter addresses the above limitations.

Given its low cost and simplicity (a single LED indicator),
the epidemic dosimeter can be easily and affordably deployed to
lower income countries and marginalized parts of a population
serving billions.
Its resemblance to existing diagnostic devices,
and the ability to distribute it without exchanging documentation
can also allay the fears of those who worry about the privacy implications
of phone apps.
By extension, its existence will also increase the acceptance
of comparable phone apps.

## Overview and Use

<img width="300" alt="Epidemic dosimeter concept drawing" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dspinellis/epidose/master/hardware/concept.svg">

The epidemic dosimeter is a lightweight (<100g), low-cost
(mass-produced <40€), self-contained device, housed in a package with a
three-color LED.
One simply picks it up from a distribution point without
providing any personal data, charges it, and carries it around.
When health authorities test people, they associate its contacts with the
test results by attaching the dosimeter to a special beacon.

A single LED indicates the dosimeter’s status.

* Flashing green: Normal operation
* Slow flashing red: User may have been exposed and should contact a
  health provider.
* Rapidly flashing red: User has been tested positive and needs to self
  quarantine. (To be used in areas lacking better means to contact people.)
* Orange: Charging is required.
  It is estimated that the dosimeter would last a full working day without
  charging.

As a possible extension the LED indicator can be extended to more
LEDs to indicate:

* the level of exposure, and
* by tracking other encountered Bluetooth devices, the effectiveness
  of the user's social distancing measures.

## Technology
The epidemic dosimeter works by acting as a
[Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy)
(BLE) beacon to transmit periodically-changing random identifiers,
and as a corresponding beacon receiver to track individuals carrying
a dosimeter located in the vicinity.
By basing its code on the DP3T reference implementation it should also
interoperate with the corresponding smartphone applications.
The dosimeter's design calls for it to be pre-configured to
obtain possibly infected contacts and software updates through a
global WiFi sharing network, such as that offered by [fon](https://fon.com/).

## Software architecture
The dosimeter's software is designed around the following components,
as depicted in the diagram at the end of this section.

* `beacon_tx_unlinkable_d.py`: Continuously running transmitter of ephemeral
  identifiers.
  Each day a new set of identifiers are created, stored in a database,
  and transmitted.  Every 15 minutes the transmitted identifier changes.
  Each day the transmitter also purges from the database ephemeral
  identifiers that no longer need to be retained.
* `beacon_rx_unlinkable_d.py`: Continuously running receiver of
  identifiers transmitted by other devices.
  These are again stored in a database in hashed format to allow
  the identification of contacts with infected persons.
  Each day the received also purges from the database received hashes
  that no longer need to be retained.
* `create_filter.py`: A program that is run on the server.
  It takes as input epoch identifiers and ephemeral identification hashes
  and produces a [Cuckoo filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_filter)
  that can be used to check for possible contacts with infected persons.
* `check_infection_risk.py`: A program that is run on the
  epidemic dosimeter.
  It takes as input the Cuckoo filter, and calculates
  the number of infected contacts found in the database.
  The application updates the indicator LED according to the result.
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database for storing the
  created and received ephemeral identifiers.
* `update_filter_d.sh`: A continuously running script that downloads
  from the server the Cuckoo filter for the identifiers of infected contacts,
  and checks whether the device's user is affected or not.
* `upload_seeds.py`: Subject to an agreement between the user and
  the health authority, implemented through a physical interlock and
  a suitable protocol, this uploads to a health authority's server the
  seeds used for transmitting ephemeral ids of a user found to be infected,
  using a supplied key.
* `upload_seeds_d.sh`: Continuously waits for user authorization to
  upload an affected user's ephemeral id seeds to the Health Authority.
* `watchdog_d.py`: Monitors the correct operation of all components and
  flashes the green LED to indicate correct operation.
  It also resets the device in case of a failure.
* `update_client.sh`: Runs periodically to download an updated filter,
  check for contacts with infected persons, and perform any required
  software updates.
* `ha_server.py`: The health authority's server, which receives
  lists of infected person's contacts and provides filter updates.
* A device running in testing centers acts as a user interface and
  source of trust.  It allows health professionals, in coordination
  with the epidemic dosimeter's user, handle the uploading of its
  contacts (at that point, or when the test results are out),
  providing a single-use key to authorize and authenticate the upload.

### Circuit diagram

![Circuit diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dspinellis/epidose/master/hardware/circuit/circuit.svg?sanitize=1)


## What is implemented
Currently all the device-end functionality has been implemented and
tested, with a device reporting an _infected_ status after (manually)
downloading a filter constructed from identifiers actually transmitted
and received over Bluetooth.

The following programs are available in the `epidose` directory.

* `device/beacon_tx_unlinkable_d.py`
* `device/beacon_rx_unlinkable_d.py`
* `device/check_infection_risk.py`
* `device/upload_seeds.py`
* `device/update_filter_d.sh`
* `device/upload_seeds_d.sh`
* `back-end/create_filter.py`
* `back-end/ha_server.py`

All programs can be run with a _--help_ argument to obtain usage information.

## What is missing
The server and the device automation and configuration are under construction.
Our aim is to automate their configuration with suitable
[Puppet](https://puppet.com/) scripts.

In some places the code takes shortcuts or makes simplifications (e.g.
not using the number of messages and their strength (RSSI) for estimating
the infection risk.)  These are marked in the code with `TODO` comments.

Also missing are the following.

* The health authority user interface and upload key protocol
* The design for 3D-printing the enclosure

## Installing the reference implementation

You'll need to install the required libraries and project.
Here is how you can do it under the Ubuntu GNU/Linux distribution.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev libglib2.0-dev python3-dev python3-setuptools shellcheck sqlite3 virtualenv dh-virtualenv debhelper supervisor
git clone https://github.com/dspinellis/epidose
cd epidose
virtualenv venv -p /usr/bin/python3
. venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -e .
```

## Running the client code

After downloading the project you can run the client code
on a Raspberry-Pi Zero-W as follows.

```sh
make package
sudo make install
```

You can then monitor the device's operation with the following commands:

```sh
tail -F /var/log/beacon_tx
tail -F /var/log/beacon_rx
tail -F /var/log/upload_seeds
tail -F /var/log/update_filter
```

You can also obtain a report of what has been stored in the device's
database by running `utils/client-db-report.sh`.

## Running the back-end Health Authority server code

After downloading the project you can run the health authority server code
on a (hopefully) more powerful Raspberry-Pi host as follows.

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/epidose
sudo venv/bin/gunicorn epidose.back_end.ha_server:app --daemon --pid=/run/ha_server.pid --access-logfile=/var/log/ha_server_access_log --disable-redirect-access-to-syslog --error-logfile=/var/log/ha_server_error_log --capture-output --bind=0.0.0.0:5010
```

You can then monitor the server's operation with
`tail -F /var/log/ha_server_error_log` and
`tail -F /var/log/ha_server_access_log`.
Note that in a production setting the server process must be configured
to run behind a hardened and efficient web server, such as
[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/).


## End-to-end operation

With the client and server running, you can run an end-to-end
contact tracing scenario between an affected user and a user who
is at risk, as follows.
The example below assumes that the Health Authority server has a DNS
record named `ha-server`.

### On affected user's device
To upload the past half-hour contacts to the
health authority server press the device button is pressed to signify
the user's consent.
Normally, this will happen
after the Health Authority provides to the user's device an upload key
and information regarding the period over which the user was
infected.


If you don't have a device with a physical button you can instead
run the following command.
```sh
sudo venv/bin/python epidose/device/upload_seeds.py -d -v -s http://ha-server:5010/ $(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S' --date='30 min ago') $(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
```

### On the Health Authority server
Run the following command to create a new Cuckoo filter,
which will include the contacts of the affected user.

```sh
sudo venv/bin/python epidose/back_end/create_filter.py -v -d /var/lib/epidose/filter.bin
```

### On user's at risk device
Wait for at most six hours for the Cuckoo filter to be updated.
Alternatively,
run the following command to download the new Cuckoo filter and
check for matching contacts.

```sh
sudo epidose/device/update_filter_d.sh -l ha-server:5010
```

The filter is updated every six hours.
To force the downloading of a new filter,
remove the downloaded filter (`sudo rm /var/lib/epidose/client-filter.bin`)
and rerun the `update_filter_d.py` script.

## Development

For development, you should install the development and test dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,test,deploy]"
```

You should also install the proper pre-commit-hooks so that the files stay
formatted:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Finally, it's a good idea to clone and regularly integrate the DP-3T
reference implementation, which is the base of this code's cryptographic
protocol.

```sh
git remote add dp3t https://github.com/DP-3T/reference_implementation.git
git fetch
```

### Running the tests

To run the tests, simply call

```sh
pytest
```

If you just installed the test dependencies, you may need to reload the `venv`
(`deactivate` followed by `source venv/bin/ativate`) to ensure that the paths
are picked up correctly.

### Packaging
Run `make package` to create a package for distribution.

### Deployment
Run  `sudo make install` to deploy the package.

### Deployment refresh
After the first deployment, source code files can be deployed by
running `sudo make fast-install`.
